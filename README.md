# Store Monitoring App

## Installation Guide

To get started with the Store Monitoring App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   Clone the repository or download and extract the zip folder. Ensure that the extracted folder (named something like `store_monitoring`) is placed in your desired root directory.

2. **Install Required Dependencies**

   Navigate to the root directory in your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command installs all the Python packages needed to run the application.

3. **Prepare the Data**

   Make sure the provided `store-monitoring-data.zip` file is placed in the root folder before running the app. The application expects the zip file to be present for loading the required store monitoring data.

## Features & Potential Improvements

Here are some ways that I think the project could be improved:

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Add indexing on frequently queried columns like `store_id` and `timestamp_utc` to improve query speed.

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement authentication and authorization using JWT to restrict access to the report generation and download endpoints.

3. **Frontend Interface**
   - Create a simple web UI where store owners can log in, view real-time reports, and trigger CSV generation manually.
