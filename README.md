## Features & Potential Improvements

Here are several ways the project could be enhanced for greater efficiency and scalability:

1. Optimize performance by adding indexes on commonly queried database fields.
2. Refactor the codebase to introduce a dedicated service layer for handling business logic.
3. Secure the API by adding authentication and role-based access control.
4. Build interactive dashboards to visualize store performance metrics over time.
5. Enable monitoring alerts for anomalies or extended downtime.
6. Develop a frontend interface for store owners to monitor their own store activity.
7. Provide options to export reports not only in CSV but also JSON, Excel, or PDF.
